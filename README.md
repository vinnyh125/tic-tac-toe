# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple tic-tac-toe game created using the tic-tac-toe tutorial on the <a href=https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe target="_blank"> React documentation page</a>.

## Set Up Instructions
Download or clone the repository. In the terminal, or command prompt, cd to the repository and type <b>npm install</b>. Note: <b>npm</b> and <b>npm install</b> will only work/be available if you have <a href=https://nodejs.org/en/download target="_blank">NodeJS</a> installed. <br><br> Once you have NodeJS installed and have ran npm install on the repository, you should see some messages in the terminal or command prompt which indicate that the necessary libraries are being downloaded. After npm install has successfully ran, in a new instance of terminal or command prompt, navigate to the tic-tac-toe repository again, and type <b>npm start</b>. This should start a new tab in your browser which has the url "localhost:3000". The project "site" is here. <br><br> Now, every time you want to play the tic-tac-toe game, you can just navigate to the repo, type <b>npm start</b>, and voila, you should be able to play the tic-tac-toe game!

## Project Purpose
I just wanted to learn React. That is all.
